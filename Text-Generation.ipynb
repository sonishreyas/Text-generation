and anxious to spare the woman's feelings, \\r\",\n"," 'which, subdued at first by a violent effort, were now irrepressible and\\r',\n"," 'most painful to witness; the surgeon repeated his promise of calling in the\\r',\n"," 'morning at the appointed hour. his visitor, after giving him a direction to\\r',\n"," 'an obscure part of walworth, left the house in the same mysterious\\r',\n"," 'manner in which she had entered it.\\r',\n"," 'it will be readily believed that so extraordinary a visit produced a\\r',\n"," 'considerable impression on the mind of the young surgeon; and that he\\r',\n"," 'speculated a great deal and to very little purpose on the possible\\r',\n"," 'circumstances of the case. in common with the generality of people, he\\r',\n"," 'had often heard and read of singular instances, in which a presentiment\\r',\n"," 'of death, at a particular day, or even minute, had been entertained and\\r',\n"," 'realised. at one moment he was inclined to think that the present might\\r',\n"," 'be such a case; but, then, it occurred to him that all the anecdotes of the\\r',\n"," 'kind he had ever heard, were of persons who had been troubled with a\\r',\n"," 'foreboding of their own death. this woman, however, spoke of another\\r',\n"," 'person--a man; and it was impossible to suppose that a mere dream or\\r',\n"," 'delusion of fancy would induce her to speak of his approaching dissolution\\r',\n"," 'with such terrible certainty as she had spoken. it could not be that the\\r',\n"," 'man was to be murdered in the morning, and that the woman, originally a\\r',\n"," 'consenting party, and bound to secrecy by an oath, had relented, and,\\r',\n"," 'though unable to prevent the commission of some outrage on the victim,\\r',\n"," 'had determined to prevent his death if possible, by the timely\\r',\n"," 'interposition of medical aid? the idea of such things happening within two\\r',\n"," 'miles of the metropolis appeared too wild and preposterous to be\\r',\n"," 'entertained beyond the instant. then, his original impression that the\\r',\n"," \"woman's intellects were disordered, recurred; and, as it was the only\\r\",\n"," 'mode of solving the difficulty with any degree of satisfaction, he\\r',\n"," 'obstinately made up his mind to believe that she was mad. certain\\r',\n"," 'misgivings upon this point, however, stole upon his thoughts at the time,\\r',\n"," 'and presented themselves again and again through the long dull course of\\r',\n"," 'a sleepless night; during which, in spite of all his efforts to the contrary,\\r',\n"," 'he was unable to banish the black veil from his disturbed imagination.\\r',\n"," 'the back part of walworth, at its greatest distance from town, is a\\r',\n"," 'straggling miserable place enough, even in these days; but, five- andthirty years ago, the greater portion of it was little better than a dreary\\r',\n"," 'waste, inhabited by a few scattered people of questionable character, \\r',\n"," 'whose poverty prevented their living in any better neighbourhood, or\\r',\n"," 'whose pursuits and mode of life rendered its solitude desirable. very\\r',\n"," 'many of the houses which have since sprung up on all sides, were not\\r',\n"," 'built until some years afterwards; and the great majority even of those\\r',\n"," 'which were sprinkled about, at irregular intervals, were of the rudest and\\r',\n"," 'most miserable description.\\r',\n"," 'the appearance of the place through which he walked in the morning,\\r',\n"," 'was not calculated to raise the spirits of the young surgeon, or to dispel\\r',\n"," 'any feeling of anxiety or depression which the singular kind of visit he\\r',\n"," 'was about to make, had awakened. striking off from the high road, his\\r',\n"," 'way lay across a marshy common, through irregular lanes, with here and\\r',\n"," 'there a ruinous and dismantled cottage fast falling to pieces with decay\\r',\n"," 'and neglect. a stunted tree, or pool of stagnant water, roused into a\\r',\n"," 'sluggish action by the heavy rain of the preceding night, skirted the path\\r',\n"," 'occasionally; and, now and then, a miserable patch of garden-ground,\\r',\n"," 'with a few old boards knocked together for a summer-house, and old\\r',\n"," 'palings imperfectly mended with stakes pilfered from the neighbouring\\r',\n"," 'hedges, bore testimony, at once to the poverty of the inhabitants, and the\\r',\n"," 'little scruple they entertained in appropriating the property of other\\r',\n"," 'people to their own use. occasionally, a filthy-looking woman would make\\r',\n"," 'her appearance from the door of a dirty house, to empty the contents of\\r',\n"," 'some cooking utensil into the gutter in front, or to scream after a little\\r',\n"," 'slip-shod girl, who had contrived to stagger a few yards from the door\\r',\n"," 'under the weight of a sallow infant almost as big as herself; but, scarcely\\r',\n"," 'anything was stirring around: and so much of the prospect as could be\\r',\n"," 'faintly traced through the cold damp mist which hung heavily over it,\\r',\n"," 'presented a lonely and dreary appearance perfectly in keeping with the\\r',\n"," 'objects we have described.\\r',\n"," 'after plodding wearily through the mud and mire; making many inquiries\\r',\n"," 'for the place to which he had been directed; and receiving as many\\r',\n"," 'contradictory and unsatisfactory replies in return; the young man at\\r',\n"," 'length arrived before the house which had been pointed out to him as the\\r',\n"," 'object of his destination. it was a small low building, one story above the\\r',\n"," 'ground, with even a more desolate and unpromising exterior than any he\\r',\n"," 'had yet passed. an old yellow curtain was closely drawn across the\\r',\n"," 'window up-stairs, and the parlour shutters were closed, but not fastened. \\r',\n"," 'the house was detached from any other, and, as it stood at an angle of a\\r',\n"," 'narrow lane, there was no other habitation in sight.\\r',\n"," 'when we say that the surgeon hesitated, and walked a few paces beyond\\r',\n"," 'the house, before he could prevail upon himself to lift the knocker, we say\\r',\n"," 'nothing that need raise a smile upon the face of the boldest reader. the\\r',\n"," 'police of london were a very different body in that day; the isolated\\r',\n"," 'position of the suburbs, when the rage for building and the progress of\\r',\n"," 'improvement had not yet begun to connect them with the main body of\\r',\n"," 'the city and its environs, rendered many of them (and this in particular) a\\r',\n"," 'place of resort for the worst and most depraved characters. even the\\r',\n"," 'streets in the gayest parts of london were imperfectly lighted, at that\\r',\n"," 'time; and such places as these, were left entirely to the mercy of the\\r',\n"," 'moon and stars. the chances of detecting desperate characters, or of\\r',\n"," 'tracing them to their haunts, were thus rendered very few, and their\\r',\n"," 'offences naturally increased in boldness, as the consciousness of\\r',\n"," 'comparative security became the more impressed upon them by daily\\r',\n"," 'experience. added to these considerations, it must be remembered that\\r',\n"," 'the young man had spent some time in the public hospitals of the\\r',\n"," 'metropolis; and, although neither burke nor bishop had then gained a\\r',\n"," 'horrible notoriety, his own observation might have suggested to him how\\r',\n"," 'easily the atrocities to which the former has since given his name, might\\r',\n"," 'be committed. be this as it may, whatever reflection made him hesitate,\\r',\n"," 'he did hesitate: but, being a young man of strong mind and great\\r',\n"," 'personal courage, it was only for an instant;--he stepped briskly back and\\r',\n"," 'knocked gently at the door.\\r',\n"," 'a low whispering was audible, immediately afterwards, as if some person\\r',\n"," 'at the end of the passage were conversing stealthily with another on the\\r',\n"," 'landing above. it was succeeded by the noise of a pair of heavy boots\\r',\n"," 'upon the bare floor. the door-chain was softly unfastened; the door\\r',\n"," 'opened; and a tall, ill-favoured man, with black hair, and a face, as the\\r',\n"," 'surgeon often declared afterwards, as pale and haggard, as the\\r',\n"," 'countenance of any dead man he ever saw, presented himself.\\r',\n"," \"'walk in, sir,' he said in a low tone.\\r\",\n"," 'the surgeon did so, and the man having secured the door again, by the\\r',\n"," 'chain, led the way to a small back parlour at the extremity of the\\r',\n"," 'passage.\\r',\n"," \"'am i in time?'\\r\",\n"," \"'too soon!' replied the man. the surgeon turned hastily round, with a\\r\",\n"," 'gesture of astonishment not unmixed with alarm, which he found it\\r',\n"," 'impossible to repress.\\r',\n"," \"'if you'll step in here, sir,' said the man, who had evidently noticed the\\r\",\n"," \"action--'if you'll step in here, sir, you won't be detained five minutes, i\\r\",\n"," \"assure you.'\\r\",\n"," 'the surgeon at once walked into the room. the man closed the door, and\\r',\n"," 'left him alone.\\r',\n"," 'it was a little cold room, with no other furniture than two deal chairs, and\\r',\n"," 'a table of the same material. a handful of fire, unguarded by any fender,\\r',\n"," 'was burning in the grate, which brought out the damp if it served no\\r',\n"," 'more comfortable purpose, for the unwholesome moisture was stealing\\r',\n"," 'down the walls, in long slug-like tracks. the window, which was broken\\r',\n"," 'and patched in many places, looked into a small enclosed piece of ground,\\r',\n"," 'almost covered with water. not a sound was to be heard, either within the\\r',\n"," 'house, or without. the young surgeon sat down by the fireplace, to await\\r',\n"," 'the result of his first professional visit.\\r',\n"," 'he had not remained in this position many minutes, when the noise of\\r',\n"," 'some approaching vehicle struck his ear. it stopped; the street-door was\\r',\n"," 'opened; a low talking succeeded, accompanied with a shuffling noise of\\r',\n"," 'footsteps, along the passage and on the stairs, as if two or three men\\r',\n"," 'were engaged in carrying some heavy body to the room above. the\\r',\n"," 'creaking of the stairs, a few seconds afterwards, announced that the newcomers having completed their task, whatever it was, were leaving the\\r',\n"," 'house. the door was again closed, and the former silence was restored.\\r',\n"," 'another five minutes had elapsed, and the surgeon had resolved to\\r',\n"," 'explore the house, in search of some one to whom he might make his \\r',\n"," \"errand known, when the room-door opened, and his last night's visitor,\\r\",\n"," 'dressed in exactly the same manner, with the veil lowered as before,\\r',\n"," 'motioned him to advance. the singular height of her form, coupled with\\r',\n"," 'the circumstance of her not speaking, caused the idea to pass across his\\r',\n"," \"brain for an instant, that it might be a man disguised in woman's attire.\\r\",\n"," 'the hysteric sobs which issued from beneath the veil, and the convulsive\\r',\n"," 'attitude of grief of the whole figure, however, at once exposed the\\r',\n"," 'absurdity of the suspicion; and he hastily followed.\\r',\n"," 'the woman led the way up-stairs to the front room, and paused at the\\r',\n"," 'door, to let him enter first. it was scantily furnished with an old deal box,\\r',\n"," 'a few chairs, and a tent bedstead, without hangings or cross-rails, which\\r',\n"," 'was covered with a patchwork counterpane. the dim light admitted\\r',\n"," 'through the curtain which he had noticed from the outside, rendered the\\r',\n"," 'objects in the room so indistinct, and communicated to all of them so\\r',\n"," 'uniform a hue, that he did not, at first, perceive the object on which his\\r',\n"," 'eye at once rested when the woman rushed frantically past him, and flung\\r',\n"," 'herself on her knees by the bedside.\\r',\n"," 'stretched upon the bed, closely enveloped in a linen wrapper, and\\r',\n"," 'covered with blankets, lay a human form, stiff and motionless. the head\\r',\n"," 'and face, which were those of a man, were uncovered, save by a bandage\\r',\n"," 'which passed over the head and under the chin. the eyes were closed.\\r',\n"," 'the left arm lay heavily across the bed, and the woman held the passive\\r',\n"," 'hand.\\r',\n"," 'the surgeon gently pushed the woman aside, and took the hand in his.\\r',\n"," \"'my god!' he exclaimed, letting it fall involuntarily--'the man is dead!'\\r\",\n"," 'the woman started to her feet and beat her hands together.\\r',\n"," \"'oh! don't say so, sir,' she exclaimed, with a burst of passion, amounting\\r\",\n"," \"almost to frenzy.
